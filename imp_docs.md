## There is an air-gapped Windows system with a dash plotly app in a conda environment. All relevant packages have already been downloaded and imported in the app, which is a simole dashboard with two dropdown menus for displaying historical data fetched from a local postgresql db as px.line graphs using plotly express. Now some graphs display normally for fields selected from the dropdown menus having rekatively less data points/columns/rows in the db, while for a large dataset the graphs collapse into one another and become squished - rendering the line graph useless. If I set the height in a dict definwd in fig.update-layout (e.g. height=1200), the graphs for the large dataset render properly but become extremely large for oprions selected with less data. The xaxis & yaxis labels also overlap each other, making it all ugly. Help me fix all this!

## Issues Identified

- **Large datasets** cause graphs to collapse, overlap, and become unreadable.
    
- **Setting a fixed height** (e.g., `height=1200`) solves the issue for large datasets but makes graphs for smaller datasets excessively large.
    
- **Axis labels** (x/y) overlap when there are many data points, further reducing readability.
    

## Causes

- **Plotly Express** renders every data point, which can overwhelm the browser and the plot area with dense data, causing squishing and label overlap[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73034433/plotly-express-for-large-data-sets)[2](https://community.plotly.com/t/proper-way-to-plot-large-datasets/9793)[5](https://gurubase.io/g/python/common-pitfalls-using-plotly-interactive-plots).
    
- **Fixed layout** does not adapt to the amount of data, so small datasets look stretched while large ones are still crowded[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73034433/plotly-express-for-large-data-sets)[7](https://community.plotly.com/t/plotly-express-performance-of-huge-data-amount/31937).
    
- **Axis tick labels** become cluttered when there are many points, especially on the x-axis.
    

## Solutions

## 1. Downsample or Aggregate Large Datasets

- For large datasets, **downsample** (randomly sample or pick every nth point) or **aggregate** (average, sum, or bin data by time or category) before plotting. This reduces the number of points shown, making the plot readable and responsive[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73034433/plotly-express-for-large-data-sets)[5](https://gurubase.io/g/python/common-pitfalls-using-plotly-interactive-plots)[7](https://community.plotly.com/t/plotly-express-performance-of-huge-data-amount/31937).
    
- Example (downsampling):
    

python

`if len(df) > 5000:     df_plot = df.sample(5000) else:     df_plot = df`

- Example (binning/aggregation):
    

python

`# For time series, resample by hour/day/etc. df_plot = df.resample('1H').mean()`

## 2. Use WebGL Rendering for Large Line Graphs

- For very large datasets, use `Scattergl` from `plotly.graph_objects` instead of Plotly Express, as it leverages GPU acceleration for better performance[5](https://gurubase.io/g/python/common-pitfalls-using-plotly-interactive-plots)[11](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1eyt54b/exploring_efficient_rendering_of_large_datasets/):
    

python

`import plotly.graph_objects as go fig = go.Figure(go.Scattergl(x=df_plot['x'], y=df_plot['y'], mode='lines'))`

## 3. Dynamically Adjust Figure Height

- Set the figure height **dynamically** based on the number of data points or series being plotted. For example:
    

python

`base_height = 400 extra_height_per_1000 = 100 height = base_height + (len(df_plot) // 1000) * extra_height_per_1000 fig.update_layout(height=height)`

- This keeps small plots compact and expands only for large datasets.
    

## 4. Manage Axis Tick Labels

- **Limit the number of ticks** or use `tickformatstops` to auto-rotate or skip labels for large datasets:
    

python

`fig.update_xaxes(nticks=10, tickangle=45, automargin=True) fig.update_yaxes(automargin=True)`

- For date/time axes, use `tickformat` or `dtick` to control spacing.
    

## 5. General Plotly/Dash Best Practices

- Avoid plotting more than ~10,000 points interactively; aggregate or sample if needed[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73034433/plotly-express-for-large-data-sets)[2](https://community.plotly.com/t/proper-way-to-plot-large-datasets/9793)[5](https://gurubase.io/g/python/common-pitfalls-using-plotly-interactive-plots)[7](https://community.plotly.com/t/plotly-express-performance-of-huge-data-amount/31937).
    
- For dropdowns, **precompute** or cache the downsampled/aggregated data for each option if possible.
    

## Example Workflow

python

`def get_plot_data(df):     if len(df) > 10000:        # Aggregate or downsample        df = df.resample('1H').mean()  # or df.sample(10000)    return df def make_figure(df):     df_plot = get_plot_data(df)    height = 400 + (len(df_plot) // 1000) * 100    fig = px.line(df_plot, x='timestamp', y='value')    fig.update_layout(height=height)    fig.update_xaxes(nticks=10, tickangle=45, automargin=True)    fig.update_yaxes(automargin=True)    return fig`

## How can I optimize the rendering of large datasets in Plotly Dash

#### Optimizing Rendering of Large Datasets in Plotly Dash

To efficiently render large datasets in Plotly Dash, especially for interactive dashboards, consider the following proven strategies:

## **1. Leverage WebGL Rendering**

- Use `Scattergl` (via `plotly.graph_objects.Scattergl` or `plotly.express.scatter`) to harness GPU acceleration, which can handle up to 200,000 data points smoothly in most browsers[1](https://community.plotly.com/t/rendering-large-datasets-in-plotly-dash/86748)[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1eyt54b/exploring_efficient_rendering_of_large_datasets/)[4](https://ploomber.io/blog/plotly-large-dataset/)[5](https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/1eyt1jo/plotting_large_datasets_in_dashplotly/).
    
- Plotly Express will automatically switch to WebGL for scatter plots with more than 1,000 points, but for full control and large line plots, explicitly use `Scattergl`[4](https://ploomber.io/blog/plotly-large-dataset/).
    

## **2. Dynamic Data Aggregation with plotly-resampler**

- For datasets larger than what WebGL can handle, use the `plotly-resampler` library. It dynamically downsamples and aggregates data, showing only a manageable number of points while preserving trends and details[1](https://community.plotly.com/t/rendering-large-datasets-in-plotly-dash/86748)[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1eyt54b/exploring_efficient_rendering_of_large_datasets/)[4](https://ploomber.io/blog/plotly-large-dataset/)[5](https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/1eyt1jo/plotting_large_datasets_in_dashplotly/).
    
- This approach is particularly effective for time series data, allowing fast rendering and interactive zooming even with millions of rows.
    

## **3. Combine WebGL and plotly-resampler**

- You can combine both techniques: use `Scattergl` as the base trace inside a `FigureResampler` object. This maximizes performance and detail retention for very large datasets[4](https://ploomber.io/blog/plotly-large-dataset/).
    
- Example:
    
    python
    
    `from plotly_resampler import FigureResampler import plotly.graph_objects as go fig = FigureResampler(go.Figure()) fig.add_trace(go.Scattergl(     x=large_df['x'], y=large_df['y'], mode='lines' ), hf_x=large_df['x'], hf_y=large_df['y'], max_n_samples=100000)`
    

## **4. Preprocess and Clean Data**

- Remove unnecessary columns and clean the dataset before plotting to reduce memory usage and improve rendering speed[5](https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/1eyt1jo/plotting_large_datasets_in_dashplotly/).
    
- For very large datasets, consider chunking or loading only relevant data ranges as needed[8](https://community.plotly.com/t/loading-large-datasets-into-dash-app/62680).
    

## **5. Adjust Plot Layout Dynamically**

- Dynamically set figure height, axis ticks, and margins based on the number of data points or series to maintain readability and avoid label overlap.
    

## **6. Consider Specialized Tools for Extreme Cases**

- For geospatial or map-based visualizations, use optimized layers or libraries designed for large-scale rendering[7](https://plotly.com/blog/performance-optimization-geospatial/).
    
- Tools like LensPy or custom client-side downsampling may be relevant, but their maturity and support may vary[6](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64917524/plotly-dash-large-dataset-densitymapbox-memory-usage).
    

## **Summary Table**

|Dataset Size|Recommended Strategy|
|---|---|
|Up to ~200,000 pts|WebGL (`Scattergl`)|
|>200,000 pts|plotly-resampler (dynamic aggregation)|
|Millions of pts|Combine plotly-resampler + WebGL|

**Key Takeaway:**  
For large datasets in Plotly Dash, use WebGL for GPU-accelerated rendering and plotly-resampler for dynamic aggregation. Combining both ensures fast, interactive, and readable plots even with millions of data points[1](https://community.plotly.com/t/rendering-large-datasets-in-plotly-dash/86748)[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1eyt54b/exploring_efficient_rendering_of_large_datasets/)[4](https://ploomber.io/blog/plotly-large-dataset/)[5](https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/1eyt1jo/plotting_large_datasets_in_dashplotly/).
