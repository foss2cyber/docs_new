To install Python packages offline on a Windows PC within a Conda environment, you need to follow these steps:

### 1. **Download the Required Packages:**

First, you'll need to download the required packages (and their dependencies) from an online machine.

- On an online machine, activate the Conda environment you intend to use:
    
    ```bash
    conda activate your_env_name
    ```
    
- Use `pip` to download the desired packages, specifying the `--download` option to store the `.whl` (wheel) files. For example, if you're trying to download `numpy`:
    
    ```bash
    pip download numpy
    ```
    
    This will download the `.whl` files and any other dependencies needed in the current directory.
    
- You can also specify additional packages if needed, and pip will resolve and download all dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    pip download package_name1 package_name2
    ```
    
- Make sure to download all the dependencies that are required for your packages.
    

### 2. **Transfer the Packages to the Offline Machine:**

After downloading the packages, transfer the entire folder containing the `.whl` files (or the downloaded `.tar.gz` files) to the offline machine using a USB drive, external hard drive, or other storage methods.

### 3. **Create a Conda Environment (If Not Already Created):**

If you don't already have the Conda environment set up on the offline machine, you can create it like so:

```bash
conda create --name your_env_name python=3.x
```

### 4. **Activate the Conda Environment:**

On the offline machine, activate the environment where you want to install the packages:

```bash
conda activate your_env_name
```

### 5. **Install Packages Using Pip from Local Files:**

Once you have transferred the package files to the offline machine, use `pip` to install them from the local directory where you placed them. For example:

```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links=/path/to/your/package/folder package_name
```

- `--no-index` tells pip not to look for packages in online repositories.
    
- `--find-links` specifies the folder where the `.whl` files are stored.
    

You can also install multiple packages at once by listing all `.whl` files:

```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links=/path/to/your/package/folder *.whl
```

Or if you have a `requirements.txt` file with a list of packages, you can do:

```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links=/path/to/your/package/folder -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. **Verify Installation:**

After installation, verify that the packages are installed correctly:

```bash
pip list
```

This will show all the installed packages in your Conda environment, and you should see the packages you installed listed there.

### Notes:

- Some dependencies may need to be downloaded manually if they aren't resolved automatically by `pip download` (e.g., C libraries or specific binary dependencies).
    
- The packages you download must be compatible with the version of Python you're using and the platform (Windows) you're installing on.

Since you’ve already downloaded all the necessary packages and their dependencies, here’s the process to install them on the offline PC in your Conda environment:

### 1. **Ensure You Have a Conda Environment Set Up**

If you haven’t already created and activated the desired Conda environment on your offline PC, you can do so using the following commands:

```bash
conda create --name your_env_name python=3.x
conda activate your_env_name
```

Replace `your_env_name` with the desired name of your environment and `3.x` with the desired version of Python.

### 2. **Transfer the Packages to the Offline PC**

Make sure that you’ve transferred the downloaded `.whl` files, `.tar.gz` files, or any other Python package files to the offline PC.

- Create a folder on the offline machine (e.g., `C:\packages`) and place all the downloaded files in it.
    

### 3. **Install the Packages from Local Directory**

Now, you can install the packages using `pip` from the local directory.

- Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window and activate your Conda environment:
    
    ```bash
    conda activate your_env_name
    ```
    
- Then, use `pip` to install the packages from the local directory where you’ve saved the files. For example:
    
    ```bash
    pip install --no-index --find-links="C:\path\to\packages" package_name
    ```
    
    Replace `C:\path\to\packages` with the actual path to the folder containing the `.whl` or other package files.
    
    - `--no-index` ensures that `pip` does not attempt to access the internet.
        
    - `--find-links` points to the folder where the downloaded packages are stored.
        
- If you have a list of all the packages in a `requirements.txt` file, you can install them all at once:
    
    ```bash
    pip install --no-index --find-links="C:\path\to\packages" -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    The `requirements.txt` should contain the names of the packages, one per line, in the format you'd normally use with `pip`.
    

### 4. **Install All Packages at Once**

If you don’t have a `requirements.txt` file, and all the packages are `.whl` files in the same directory, you can use a wildcard (`*`) to install all the `.whl` files at once:

```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links="C:\path\to\packages" *.whl
```

### 5. **Verify the Installation**

After installation, verify that everything is installed correctly by running:

```bash
pip list
```

This will show you all installed packages in your environment. Check if all your desired packages are listed.

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter dependency issues (e.g., a missing `.whl` for a specific package), you may need to manually download the missing package on an online machine and repeat the process for that specific dependency.
    
- Ensure that the `.whl` files are compatible with your Python version (e.g., `cp38` for Python 3.8, `cp39` for Python 3.9) and system architecture (e.g., `win_amd64` for 64-bit Windows).
    

This process should help you successfully install all the required packages and their dependencies in your offline Conda environment.
